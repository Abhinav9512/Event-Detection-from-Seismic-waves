# Event-Detection-from-Seismic-waves
Event Detection is a technique used to identify if there is any event present in the given signal or not. 
For this, I have implemented Amplitude Thresholding, Kurtosis based event Detection, STA/LTA based event Detection and MER based event detection technique.
For event extraction, I have implemented Adaptive Thresholding algorithm.
